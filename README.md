git submodule update

Run the following command

```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh

All the needed tools will be downloaded automatically.

## Customization

You are free to modify my configuration to suit your needs.

Here is a list of places to start:

- `[install/brew-cask.sh](./install/brew-cask.sh)`: contains all the applications
- `[install/brew.sh](./install/brew.sh)`: contains all the command line utilities
- `[install/fonts.sh](./install/fonts.sh)`: contains all the custom fonts
- `[install/mas.sh](./install/mas.sh)`: contains all the Mac App Store applications
- `[install/npm.sh](./install/npm.sh)`: contains all the node command line utilities
- `[install/zsh.sh](./install/zsh.sh)`: contains the list of all the zsh plugins

The config folder contains all the configurations of the applications we are going to install.
The most interesting path is definitely `config/nvim/lua/custom` where you can find my configuration for _neovim_.

Finally, the `dotfiles` folder contains all my personal dotfiles, feel free to modify them as you see fit.
